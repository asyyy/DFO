binMeta project

This is the very preliminary version of a Java project having as main aim of collecting in one 
unique Java package the several meta-heuristic searches that have been proposed over the last 
years for the solution of combinatorial optimization problems.

This initial version contains only a RandomWalk, and uses only 3 unconstrained optimization 
problems for the tests. These are provided, together with the abstract classes named "binMeta"
and "Objective", mainly to give a guidance for the development of other classes, implementing
other meta-heuristic searches, as well as for the evaluation of other optimization problems.

The next version of the project is supposed to collect the best implementations given by
the students of the course on "Multi-threading Operating Systems" (Master in Computer Science, 
ISTIC, University of Rennes1), to which a different meta-heuristic search was assigned in
the first semester of the academic year 2020-21.

This is one of the reasons why the current Java classes are not intensely commented, as it is 
part of the students' tasks to check and understand the provided code, which will be at the basis 
of their implementations.

By the way, why "binMeta"? The "bin" part can be interpreted as "binary", which is important
to point out in this project because all the implemented meta-heuristic searches are supposed 
to directly work with a binary representations of the data. Moreover, if you know some German, 
the "bin" may remind you of "(ich) bin" (I am), followed by "Meta", which recalls the name 
"meta-heuristic", but it can be interpreted as something beyond the simple implementation of 
one meta-heuristic search.
